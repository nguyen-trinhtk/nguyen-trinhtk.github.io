"My experience spans multiple technologies, including Python, C/C++, and Java; full-stack development with Flutter, React, Flask, and Node.js; cloud platforms like GCP and AWS; and machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, YOLO, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. Iâ€™m also comfortable working close to hardware with tools like Arduino and LiDAR, and managing systems with Docker, ROS, and Linux-based embedded computers.",
